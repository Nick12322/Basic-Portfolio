            My name is Nicholas Woodward and I am a 22 year old web developer. I was born in New Jersey and moved to California in 
            April of 2017.<br><br> My first exposure to a computer was when I was about 5 years old and my parents bought an HP desktop from
            best buy. I was fascinated with it from the beginning. Since then, I have had an interest in computing and technology, which
            was further compounded by my introduction to xbox live a few years later by my uncle.<br><br> I am currently taking a programming
            bootcamp at UCSD which will hopefully lead to my first job as a developer in the coming months. Stay tuned!
